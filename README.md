Multi-order type orderbook project using the FIFO as the queue priority algorithm with price-time priority 

To-do:
    - Implement yfinance price association either through a csv with a enums numbering style or string error handling 
    - Implement FOK orders and Market orders 
    - Possible object address error to fix in self.bids and self.asks
    - Can add the time module and add a parameter to order that shows how long the order has been live for 
    - Also could add a csv file containing all past trades at x price 
    - Once the orderbook is solid level up your API either with a GUI or web servers
